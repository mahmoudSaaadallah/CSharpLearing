             * In summary, passing a reference type by value allows you to modify the properties or fields of 
             *     the original object, but passing by reference allows you to modify the reference itself, 
             *     which can lead to changes in the object the reference points to. Be cautious when using 
             *     ref parameters, as modifying the reference itself might lead to unexpected behavior and 
             *     make your code harder to understand and maintain. It is generally recommended to pass
             *     reference types by value whenever possible, unless you have specific requirements for 
             *     modifying the reference itself.

    /// In C#, a struct (short for "structure") is a value type that represents a composite data type.
    /// Unlike classes, which are reference types, structs are value types, meaning they are stored directly
    ///   in memory where they are declared rather than being stored in the heap and referenced indirectly.
    /// Structs are generally used for lightweight data structures that have a small memory footprint and
    ///    are frequently copied.
    ///    
    /// Here are some key characteristics of structs in C#:
    /// 1. **Value Type**: Structs are value types, which means they are copied when assigned to another
    ///   variable or passed as a method parameter.This is in contrast to classes, which are reference types and are passed by reference.
    ///   
    /// 2. **Memory Allocation**: Structs are allocated on the stack or as part of another object's memory
    ///  allocation, making them more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance compared to classes.
    ///  
    /// 3. **Constructor**: Structs can have constructors, but unlike classes, they cannot have a default
    ///   (parameterless) constructor.All fields of a struct must be initialized in a constructor.
    ///   
    /// 4. **Inheritance**: Structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes, and they cannot serve as 
    ///   a base for other classes or structs.
    ///   
    /// 5. **Members**: Structs can have fields, properties, methods, and events, similar to
    ///   classes.However, they cannot have finalizers (destructors) or be used as base types.
    ///   
    /// 6. **Default Values**: If a struct is not explicitly initialized, its fields will be assigned 
    ///   default values(zero or null values) based on their data types.
    ///   
    /// 7. **Copying and Equality**: When you assign a struct to another variable or pass it as a method 
    ///   parameter, a copy of the struct is made.Each copy has its own separate data.Equality for structs 
    ///   is based on the values of their fields.
    ///     
    /// 8. **Immutable**: It's a good practice to design structs to be immutable (i.e., their fields   cannot be changed after creation). This helps maintain consistency and predictability.

        ///   An assembly is a compiled unit of code that could be a single .NET executable file, a DLL

    /// Enums make code more readable, maintainable, and self-documenting by giving meaningful names to specific values. 
    /// 
    /// In this example, an enum named DaysOfWeek is defined, containing the names of the days of the week as constants.
    /// Each constant represents a unique integer value starting from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).
    /// Enums are indexed starting from 0 by default, but you can assign specific integer values to enum constants if needed.
    /// 
    /// Enums are particularly useful when you want to represent a limited set of options or states in your code. 
    /// They improve code readability by using descriptive names instead of hard-coded integer values.
    /// 
    /// Key points about enums in C#:
    /// 1. Underlying Type: Enums have an underlying integral type(usually int), and each enum member corresponds 
    ///    to a unique integer value of that type.
    ///    
    /// 2. Value Assignment: By default, the first enum member has a value of 0, and subsequent members are 
    ///    assigned values incrementing by 1. However, you can explicitly assign values to enum members.
    /// 
    /// 3. Comparisons: Enums are compared using value equality.You can use enums in comparisons, switch statements,
    ///     and as method parameters.
    ///     
    /// 4. ToString(): Calling ToString() on an enum member returns its name as a string.
    /// 
    /// 5.  Casting: You can cast an enum value to its underlying type and vice versa.
    /// 
    /// 6.  Namespace: Enums are typically defined within a namespace.
